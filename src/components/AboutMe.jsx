				Hello, I am just a guy that finds a lot of the facets of technology
				really fascinating. I've been interested in gettings things to work ever
				since I was really little. From setting up the family electronics when I
				was just starting to walk to now pursuing a Masters at Colorado
				University for Computer Science, I like to keep learning and playing
				with new things.

				I've worked on a diverse array of enterprise gear in data centers around

				I touch anything part of a cloud network or any other form of
				distributed system gives me a few extra things to keep in my back pocket
				when I am studying anything new or writing code that not everyone will
				get the chance to make use of and I'm grateful for it!
